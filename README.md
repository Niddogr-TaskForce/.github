# **Skitskola: The Ultimate Quiz Platform**  
*Developed by Niddogr TaskForce*  

### **🏫 About the Project**  
This was the most ambitious academic project I’ve ever worked on—a full-stack, multi-platform quiz application designed for both web and mobile. Developed in an **Agile environment** with a team of 6, we delivered a feature-rich app across four iterative versions, with teachers acting as clients.  

The goal? To create a dynamic quiz experience starting with simple single-player gameplay and evolving into a **social, AI-powered platform** with multiplayer modes, custom quizzes, and even AI-generated questions.  

### **🎮 Key Features**  
#### **Core Evolution**  
- **v0**: Basic single-player quizzes using [OpenTriviaDB](https://opentdb.com) (categories, difficulty, question count).  
- **v1**: Advanced quiz creation (custom questions, publishing workflow, user dashboards).  
- **v2**: **Multiplayer modes** (Time Attack, Scrum, Team Battles) and multimedia answers (text, images, audio).  
- **v3**: **AI integration** (local Ollama models) to auto-generate realistic/funny answers for custom questions.  

#### **Standout Mechanics**  
- **Multiplatform Sync**: Play on web or mobile, resume games anytime.  
- **Anti-Cheat**: Correct answers never exposed client-side.  
- **Scrum Mode**: Real-time battles where fastest correct answer wins.  
- **Team Mode**: Collaborative scoring with customizable difficulty.  
- **AI Tools**: Generate plausible or humorous fake answers for quizzes.  

### **👨‍💻 Team Role**  
Elies **Scrum Master** :  
- Bridged client-teacher communication to refine requirements.  
- Orchestrated task delegation based on team strengths (React, API design, backend logic).  
- Spearheaded documentation and led daily standups.  
- Contributed heavily to the **React frontend** (UI/UX, CSS animations) and assisted with API integrations. 

(members that will agree to appear will fill their role.) 

### **🛠️ Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend**: React (Web), React Native (Mobile)  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express  
- **Database**: SQLite (quiz storage), Redis (real-time multiplayer)  
- **AI**: Ollama (local LLM for answer generation)  
- **DevOps**: Docker for deployment

### **Why It Matters**  
Skitskola wasn’t just about quizzes—it was about **scalability, real-time collaboration, and creative problem-solving**. From ensuring seamless cross-device gameplay to implementing AI ethically (no paid APIs!), our team pushed boundaries while keeping the focus on **user fun**.
